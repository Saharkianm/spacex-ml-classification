Predicting Rocket Landings | A classification project using ML models to analyze Falcon 9 first-stage landing success.

# ðŸš€ SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction  
This project analyzes SpaceX launch data to predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket successfully lands. We use *four supervised machine learning models* to compare their performance in solving this *binary classification problem*.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
SpaceX aims to reduce launch costs by reusing rocket boosters. This project explores how different factors influence a *Falcon 9 first-stage landing success* using machine learning techniques.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)  

## ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Models  
The following models were trained and evaluated:  
âœ… Logistic Regression  
âœ… Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
âœ… Decision Tree  
âœ… k Nearest Neighbors
